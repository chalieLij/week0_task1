# AI-Agent Accelerated Machine Learning Workflows with Tenx MCP

**TRP 1 Assessment – Chalie, Addis Ababa, February 2026**

This repo demonstrates configuring GitHub Copilot as an AI coding agent for efficient ML/Data Science workflows. Using Tenx MCP logging for interaction quality (clarity, context, efficiency), rules inspired by Boris Cherny's Claude Code practices (parallel thinking, plan mode, verification loops, shared learnings), and iterative testing on ML-relevant tasks (e.g., data preprocessing, model training endpoints).

Tenx MCP active throughout.
